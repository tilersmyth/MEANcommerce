# MEANcommerce

Welcome to the MEANcommerce repository on GitHub. This is a package intended for use with <a href="http://mean.io/">Mean.io</a>, which will (*eventually*) serve as a turn-key MEAN Stack ([MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/)) e-commerce solution!

Check out the <a href="https://github.com/linnovate/mean">Mean.io</a> repository for documentation on how to get started.
